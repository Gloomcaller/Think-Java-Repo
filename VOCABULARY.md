**Inheritance**: The ability to define a new class that has the same instance variables and methods of an existing class.

**Instance**: A member of a class. Every object is an instance of a class.

**Instance method**: A non-static method that has access to this and the instance variables.

**Instance variable**: An attribute of an object; a non-static variable defined at the class level.

**JDK**: The “Java Development Kit”, which contains the compiler, Javadoc, and other tools.

**JVM**: The “Java Virtual Machine”, which interprets the compiled byte code.

**Keyword**: A reserved word used by the compiler to analyze programs. You cannot use keywords (like public, class, and void) as variable names.

**Literal**: A value that appears in source code. For example, "Hello" is a string literal, and 74 is an integer literal.

**Loop**: A statement that executes a sequence of statements repeatedly.

**Local variable**: A variable declared inside a method. Local variables cannot be accessed from outside their method.

**Loop body**: The statements inside the loop.

**Logic error**: An error in a program that makes it do something other than what the programmer intended.

**Method**: A named sequence of statements.

**Memory diagram**: A graphical representation of the state of a program at a point in time.

**Method signature**: The first line of a method that defines its name, return type, and parameters.

**Merge sort**: A recursive sorting algorithm that divides an array into two parts, sorts each part (using merge sort), and merges the results.

**NaN**: A special floating-point value that stands for “not a number”.

**Newline**: A special character signifying the end of a line of text. Also known as “line ending”, “end of line” (EOL), or “line break”.

**Nesting**: Putting a conditional statement inside one or both branches of another conditional statement.

**Object**: A collection of related data that comes with a set of methods that operate on the data.

**Operator**: A symbol that represents a computation like addition, multiplication, or string concatenation.

**Object-oriented**: A way of organizing code and data into objects, rather than independent methods.
