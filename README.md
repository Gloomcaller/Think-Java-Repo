# Think-Java-Repo

This repository contains all the projects and exercises I have completed while going through the "Think Java" book. 

## Structure

Each chapter has its own folder, and inside each folder, there are subfolders for each exercise or project related to that chapter.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to track my progress and to have a central place for all my code as I learn Java.

## Notes

- This is a private repository meant for personal use.
- The code here is based on the exercises and projects from the "Think Java" book.
