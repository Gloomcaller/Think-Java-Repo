# Think-Java-Repo

This repository is dedicated to storing all my code, projects, and exercises from the **Think Java** book. It serves as a personal learning hub where I can track my progress through the book, and it’s also available for others to explore and learn from if they wish.

Each project in this repository corresponds to a chapter of the book and is organized as follows:

- **Chapters**: Contains classes, projects, and assignments that reflect the chapter’s concepts and topics.
- **Exercises**: Includes additional exercises from the exercises section in every chapter and code examples that reinforce the learning.

## Purpose

The main objective of this repository is to provide a structured, easy-to-navigate space for me to:
- Track my progress through the **Think Java** book.
- Store all the code, assignments, and projects that help me improve my Java skills.
- Document key concepts and solutions as I advance in my learning journey.

Additionally, the repository is meant to be a reference point for anyone else who may want to explore the **Think Java** exercises and projects. The code and explanations are available for others to learn from or use in their own study of Java programming.

## Vocabulary

Alongside this README, there is a `VOCABULARY.md` file located in the root of the repository. It contains all the definitions from the **Think Java** book, providing quick reference to important terms and concepts.

## License

## Notes

- This repository is private and primarily for personal use, though others are welcome to explore and learn from it.
- The code and projects are based on exercises and assignments from the **Think Java** book.
- Some solutions in the later chapters may differ from the book’s exact instructions. Every programmer approaches problems differently, and I encourage others to work on their own solutions. What you’ll see in my code are my interpretations, aimed at keeping everything readable, simple, and easy to understand.

## Contributing

While this repository is primarily for personal use, if you find anything interesting or useful and would like to contribute, feel free to fork the repo and submit a pull request with any improvements, suggestions, or additional exercises you have worked on.
