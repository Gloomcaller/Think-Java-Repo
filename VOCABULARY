**JDK**: The “Java Development Kit”, which contains the compiler, Javadoc, and other tools.
**JVM**: The “Java Virtual Machine”, which interprets the compiled byte code.
**keyword**: A reserved word used by the compiler to analyze programs. You cannot use keywords (like public, class, and void) as variable names.
**literal**: A value that appears in source code. For example, "Hello" is a string literal, and 74 is an integer literal.
**loop**: A statement that executes a sequence of statements repeatedly.
**local variable**: A variable declared inside a method. Local variables cannot be accessed from outside their method.
**loop body**: The statements inside the loop.
**logic error**: An error in a program that makes it do something other than what the programmer intended.
**method**: A named sequence of statements.
**memory diagram**: A graphical representation of the state of a program at a point in time.
**method signature**: The first line of a method that defines its name, return type, and parameters.
**merge sort**: A recursive sorting algorithm that divides an array into two parts, sorts each part (using merge sort), and merges the results.
**NaN**: A special floating-point value that stands for “not a number”.
**newline**: A special character signifying the end of a line of text. Also known as “line ending”, “end of line” (EOL), or “line break”.
**nesting**: Putting a conditional statement inside one or both branches of another conditional statement.
**object**: A collection of related data that comes with a set of methods that operate on the data.
